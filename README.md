checking out the new rails4 tutorial

##### Hour 1: Ch1 - Ch2.31
impressed with the effort that they spent. loads of links and tons of time spent explaining everything. 
this is targeted for someone new to programming it feels like. points for the git, github and heroku intros.
first hour took me through ruby, rubygems, rvm, bundler, rails new and a few scaffolds. I moved pretty fast through
the git and heroku parts.
